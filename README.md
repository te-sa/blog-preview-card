### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11700985/margin-top-not-working-for-span-element) - I wasn't sure why margin-top was not working for my span element. This post made me realize that inline elements like span don't have vertical margins. I was able to add the desired margin after adding `display: inline-block;` to the span.
